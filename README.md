# Usage
Find 100 targets in the cropped region to remove the HUD and toolbelt on a fullscreen 1080p display at 100% UI scale:

`/usr/bin/python3 vaporize.py 100`

The parameter is the number of clicks you'd like to send

# Requirements

`pip3 install pyautogui`

Optional: If you have `notify-send` you will get some basic output notifications as the script runs

If you need to use a different crop region, you can change the first couple of lines of the pyautogui screenshot command.

Please feel free to ask questions! 

# Warranty
Don't shoot your own guns and trains! It clicks red regardless of force. It will click custom UI elements as well. 

Buyer beware!!!
